Description
-----------

Ultimate Curveball is a 3D pong-like game modeled after the
popular online flash game 'Curveball'. In it, the player is
pitted against an AI opponent where the objective is to 
score as many points as possible by curving the ball into 
the goal. Both the player and the opponent have a set amount
of lives and when the AI has lost all of its lives the 
player is moved to the next, more difficult, level. Bonus
points are awarded depending on the severity of the curve 
that the player is able to apply to the ball.

How To Play
-----------

To start the game, left-click on the paddle. This will start
the ball moving an dstarts the game. After every score (for 
either player), the ball will be moved back to the center and
the program will wait for user input (left-click on the 
paddle) before starting the new rally.

What Does This Button Do?
------------

While the basics of playing were outlined in the 'How To Play'
section, there are some other actions and keys that would
benefit the player to know:

RIGHT CLICK - Right clicking inside the window will open the
game's menu where the player can change the backround color,
enable GLSL, change the paddle from a wireframe to a solid
shape, start a new game, or exit.

SPACEBAR - The spacebar pauses (and unpauses) the game which
is convenient if the player needs to change a setting or go
to the washroom.

W - The W key changes the background color between White and
Black.

E - The E key changes the paddle between a solid wood texture 
and a transparent wire object.

I/O - The I and O keys invert the background colors so that
they are split half and half on the background, giving the
game a cool effect.

Q - The Q key is a quick way to quit the game.
